# Spill-the_Tea
HTML and CSS based project
HTML/CSS focused. 

ğŸ’» This project was heavy on the CSS and classes. 
I used flex-box to space the cards and footer information. 
There are also break points when then screen width is reduced. 
I used inline styling on one item: Github link.


***Interactive***
ğŸ«– Select your tea type (black, green, herbal). 
ğŸ«– There are three cards displayed. 
ğŸ«– One side is an image of the tea blend, second side is the tea type, preparation instructions and caffeine level. 
ğŸ«– Card flips over to display card-back when cursor comes into contact.
ğŸ«– When leaving the area the cards flip to their original position. 
  
The footer is displayed at the bottom with contact information, credits and social media links.

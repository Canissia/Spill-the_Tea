Spill the Tea
This CSS/HTML project was inspired by my lifelong love for tea. Specifically, my increased intake of tea while learning how to code. I love variety. Chai tea lead to Matcha tea to Herbal teas, each with their own preparation method. To better keep things straight I made a page that displays preparation instructions for three types of tea.

My goal was to make an interactive one-page app that displays both Tea type and Preparation Instructions.

The page includes three cards that flip over with hover effect. I googled how to achieve the ‘flip’ animation. 

I really enjoyed making this 6 hour project. I think the overall design: calm colors, smooth transition, and centeredness is the embodiment of “Tea Time”. It caused a lot of experience in flex-box as the page is responsive to different resolutions.

The footer is displayed at the bottom with contact information, credits and social media links. I used bootstrap for social media links.
